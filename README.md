React and Node js project that webscrapes using Google Search to find different places of food around you. Includes fast food, dine-in, and grocery stores. Google's Geocoding API is used to display approximate distance as well.

Run npm install to download dependencies in node and react folders.
Run npm run dev to run the webscraping script.
Afterwards npm start dev in react-app to build the react website.

Feel free to change the node webscraping script if issues arise. Webscraping can be hard to maintain and I try to fix issues I notice periodically.
